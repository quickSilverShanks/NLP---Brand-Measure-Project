# NLP---Brand-Measure-Project
 An NLP project to measure the reach of a brand in any geographic region.<br>
 <hr>
 The project currently takes an audio input file and searches for 'hardcoded' keywords. It also does the speech diarization based on silence.<br>
 Next Steps:
 <ul>
 <li>Input file for the keywords to be searched.</li>
 <li>Diarization on the basis of speaker frequency instead of silence</li>
 <li>Accent independent speech to text model</li>
 <li>Flask API for frontend</li>
 <li>Should work for multiple languages</li>
 </ul>
